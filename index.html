        Welcome to the OCADU Student Press website! The OCAD U Student Press
        serves as a platform for idea sharing, research, and communication among
        the OCAD U student and faculty community. Over the recent years, the
        student press has been lost in the void, but is back, under new
        leadership with the same ethos, to honor the community an the press
        before it.

        Early this year, the OCADU campus was adorned with brightly coloured
        posters that featured a doodled character and a snappy headline
        challenging students to work their minds like they work their
        <em>insert program sensitive tool.</em> OCADU was given a 4 million
        dollar grant by the
        <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health.html"
          >Public Health Agency of Canada</a
        >
        aimed at mental health promotion for post-secondary students impacted by
        the pandemic. They plan to do this by offering video lessons teaching
        students about mindfulness and how to practice it, In-person and virtual
        group classes (not mentioned for what exactly) and a few other voluntary
        activities aimed at enhancing individuals' well-being.

        This poster campaign was met with mixed reviews which were clear from
        the vandalization of some found around the main campus building. I spoke
        with Aysia, a 3rd-year cross-disciplinary artist who took the initiative
        and put up posters asking students to scan the displayed QR code and
        voice their anonymous opinions through a google forums sheet. With her
        permission and the permission of her group members who also worked on
        this project, have made the responses publically available. Below are
        all of the responses that Aysia and her team have gotten about the
        'mindful campus' posters.

  <!-- Your scripts should usually be referenced at the end, this is because you want them to load after the html is loaded -->
  <!-- Why you ask, its because for example if I tell javascript to do something to an html element but the html hasnt loaded cuz it comes after the javascript, there will be an error, like "wtf yyou saying gurl there's no DOM element" -->
  <!-- So yes put it at the end of the file.   -->
  <!-- There's exceptions obviosuly when you wanna put a javascript file in the top, but you dont have to worry about that yet. -->
